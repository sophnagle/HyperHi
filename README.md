# HyperHi

This site is built from Project 1 from the [SuperHi Experiemental JavaScript course](https://www.superhi.com/courses/experimental-javascript). This site draws with HTML canvas, exploring different events and adding in blend modes using CSS and JavaScript.

My version of the site can be found here: [HyperHi](https://sophnagle.github.io/HyperHi/)

The idea behind it is a user can click and reveal underneath interactively. The cursor changes as well, as a user actually scratches out the page.
